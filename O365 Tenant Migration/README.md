## Office 365 Tenant Migration

Most of these are quick and dirty code snippets that I made to facilitate moving email to the cloud and haven’t been refactored into actual tools.  As such these files shouldn’t be run as scripts since they will need some variables manually populated - it would be better to paste them as chunks into the console.  There isn’t really error handling as such, but where possible logging was added so there was a way to back out changes in an emergency.

These worked for me in an Exchange 2016 environment, even so, use carefully!
